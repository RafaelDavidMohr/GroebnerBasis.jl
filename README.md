# GB
This is a julia library which provides an interface between **Singular**
(https://github.com/Singular/Sources) and **gb** (https://github.com/ederc/gb).

It depends on **Singular.jl** (https://github.com/oscar-system/Singular.jl) for using
Singular in julia.

The package also provides a benchmark suite for various different GB
computation.
